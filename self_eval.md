# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
I feel confident with the knowledge of how to use them and knowing the resources to look up more of them or clarifications to them on Ruby-doc.org
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
I am comfortable with the sytax of writting simple methods.
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
Method seem like a powerful tool that can be brought up again. They seem like they can be made into loops that can help your code be more efficient by calling that method instead of taking more lines to write up the same solution that has already been solved earlier in your code. My question is can a method be called within another method?
